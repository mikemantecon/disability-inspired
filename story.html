                    <h3>From Humble Beginnings</h3>
                    <p>Robert's social media story is truly one of social media finding
                        him instead of the other way around. While in the midst of rehabbing and 
                        learning to walk once again after a fall, he was sitting in a Michigan
                        living room with one of his friends, when they decided to film a video of 
                        him walking and speaking about his journey and put in on TikTok. The rest is 
                        history!
