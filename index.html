                    <p>People of all abilities and on all walks of life yearn to see the accomplishments
                        and motivations associated with overcoming obstacles. Robert was born with developmental
                        and physical disabilities that have affected his ability to walk and other abilities. 
                        However, he believes that he was put on this earth to show people that those with disabilities
                        can still be cool, and cool he is! Follow on his daily journeys on social media where he gives
                        his motivation to accomplish great things in life no matter where you are on your path.
